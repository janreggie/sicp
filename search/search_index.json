(define (test x y) (if (= x 0) 0 y)) (test 0 (p)) ; don't run this on applicative-order systems On normal-order evaluation, the expression (test 0 (p)) first expands to (if (= 0 0) 0 (p)) , which will be evaluated to 0 . On applicative-order evaluation, the expression (test 0 (p)) will have (p) expanded to... (p) , and then expanded to (p) recursively, leading to no real work being done. Exercise 1.6 \u00b6 Substituting this new-if function in the procedure causes a maximum recursion depth exceeded error, even for an input of 1 . Why? (sqrt 1) ; ==> (sqrt-iter 1.0 1) ; ==> (new-if (good-enough? 1.0 1) 1.0 (sqrt-iter (improve guess x) x)) Here lies the kicker. Before new-if gets substituted, it first has to evaluate the arguments (good-enough? 1.0 1) , which easily evaluates to #t , and (sqrt-iter (improve guess x) x) , which does a recursive loop. The stack continues to grow until maximum recursion depth is reached. Exercise 1.7 \u00b6 ; eval-sqrt evaluates the sqrt function for a number (define (eval-sqrt x) (- (square (sqrt x)) x)) (eval-sqrt 4.64e-35) ; ==> .0009765625, or 9.765625e-4 (eval-sqrt 104828495672) ; ==> -.0000152587890625 Notice two things here. The first one is that the evaluation of the square root of the very small number has a ridiculously large error, where it is off by several orders of magnitude. (The real value of the square root is 6.8117e-18.) This is expected since good-enough checks if the difference between the values is less than some constant threshold: good for most cases, but bad for numbers that are smaller than said threshold. The second one is that there is always some amount of error when dealing with floating point numbers, as shown in the second example. Some precision will always be lost when dealing with floats.

In addition, running (sqrt 4.64e-35) yields 6.811756601771674e-18, really close to the actual value.

(define (test x y) (if (= x 0) 0 y)) (test 0 (p)) ; don't run this on applicative-order systems On normal-order evaluation, the expression (test 0 (p)) first expands to (if (= 0 0) 0 (p)) , which will be evaluated to 0 . On applicative-order evaluation, the expression (test 0 (p)) will have (p) expanded to... (p) , and then expanded to (p) recursively, leading to no real work being done. Exercise 1.6 \u00b6 Substituting this new-if function in the procedure causes a maximum recursion depth exceeded error, even for an input of 1 . Why? (sqrt 1) ; ==> (sqrt-iter 1.0 1) ; ==> (new-if (good-enough? 1.0 1) 1.0 (sqrt-iter (improve guess x) x)) Here lies the kicker. Before new-if gets substituted, it first has to evaluate the arguments (good-enough? 1.0 1) , which easily evaluates to #t , and (sqrt-iter (improve guess x) x) , which does a recursive loop. The stack continues to grow until maximum recursion depth is reached. Exercise 1.7 \u00b6 ; eval-sqrt evaluates the sqrt function for a number (define (eval-sqrt x) (- (square (sqrt x)) x)) (eval-sqrt 4.64e-35) ; ==> .0009765625, or 9.765625e-4 (eval-sqrt 104828495672) ; ==> -.0000152587890625 Notice two things here. The first one is that the evaluation of the square root of the very small number has a ridiculously large error, where it is off by several orders of magnitude. (The real value of the square root is 6.8117e-18.) This is expected since good-enough checks if the difference between the values is less than some constant threshold: good for most cases, but bad for numbers that are smaller than said threshold. The second one is that there is always some amount of error when dealing with floating point numbers, as shown in the second example. Some precision will always be lost when dealing with floats. Redefining good-enough to check relative to guess : ; good-enough checks if the difference between the current and next guess ; is less than 0.0001% of the current value of guess (define (good-enough guess x) (< (abs (- guess (improve guess x))) (/ guess 100000))) (eval-sqrt 4.64e-35) ; ==> 2.800177998007718e-41 (eval-sqrt 104828495672) ; ==> 991925.5386352539 While the value for error might seem much larger for large numbers, running (sqrt 104828495672) yields 323773.8216680568, not too far off from the real value of 323772.289846. In addition, running (sqrt 4.64e-35) yields 6.811756601771674e-18, really close to the actual value. Exercise 1.8 \u00b6 ; cbrt solves the cube root using Newton's method (define (cbrt x) (define (cbrt-iter guess x) (if (cbrt-goodenough guess x) guess (cbrt-iter (cbrt-improve guess x) x))) (define (cbrt-improve guess x) (/ (+ (/ x (* guess guess)) (* 2 guess)) 3)) (define (cbrt-goodenough guess x) (< (abs (- guess (cbrt-improve guess x))) (/ guess 100000))) (cbrt-iter 1.0 x)) (cbrt 27) ; ==> 3.0000005410641766 1.2 Procedures and the Processes they Generate \u00b6 Exercise 1.9 \u00b6 Supposing inc and dec are increment and decrement operators respectively, there is a difference how these two functions work: ; First process (define (+ a b) (if (= a 0) b (inc (+ (dec a) b)))) (+ 4 5) ; (inc (+ (dec 4) 5)) ; (inc (+ 3 5)) ; (inc (inc (+ (dec 3) 5))) ; (inc (inc (+ 2 5))) ; (inc (inc (inc (+ (dec 2) 5)))) ; (inc (inc (inc (+ 1 5)))) ; (inc (inc (inc (inc (+ (dec 1) 5))))) ; (inc (inc (inc (inc (+ 0 5))))) ; (inc (inc (inc (inc 5)))) ; (inc (inc (inc 6))) ; (inc (inc 7)) ; (inc 8) ; (9) ; Second process (define (+ a b) (if (= a 0) b (+ (dec a) (inc b)))) (+ 4 5) ; (+ (dec 4) (inc 5)) ; (+ 3 6) ; (+ (dec 3) (inc 6)) ; (+ 2 7) ; (+ (dec 2) (inc 7)) ; (+ 1 8) ; (+ (dec 1) (inc 8)) ; (+ 0 9) ; (9) The first process can be characterized as recursive since a chain of operations can be seen growing after every call, while the second can be characterized as iterative as the chain of operations does not grow or shrink, and the state is maintained by the parameters it contains. Exercise 1.10 \u00b6 Consider Ackermann's function: (define (A x y) (cond ((= y 0) 0) ((= x 0) (* 2 y)) ((= y 1) 2) (else (A (- x 1) (A x (- y 1)))))) From here, we see that f such that (define (f n) (A 0 n)) would just be \\(f\\left(n\\right)=2n\\) .

Consider that, ultimately, f is evaluated as a sum of three numbers, and these three numbers can be used as a state.

The base cases for \\(F\\left(0\\right)\\) and \\(F\\left(1\\right)\\) is shown to be 0 and 1. A proof is left as an exercise to the reader. Suppose that \\(F\\) follows up to \\(n-1\\) .

Exercise 1.14 \u00b6 Paths leading to a red node are unwanted, whereas paths leading to a green node are desired. Note that multiple sections of the tree repeat itself, which is why a node can have more than two paths coming towards it. An increment to amount increases the number of operations exponentially, and increases the number of nodes to compute linearly. Exercise 1.15 \u00b6 (define (cube x) (* x x x)) (define (p x) (- (* 3 x) (* 4 (cube x)))) (define (sine angle) (if (not (> (abs angle) 0.1)) angle (p (sine (/ angle 3.0))))) (sine 12.15) ; (/ angle 3.0) and (p x) operations have been substituted ; (p (sine 4.05)) ; (p (p (sine 1.35))) ; (p (p (p (sine 0.45)))) ; (p (p (p (p (sine 0.15))))) ; (p (p (p (p (p (sine 0.05)))))) ; (p (p (p (p (p 0.05))))) ; (p (p (p (p 0.1495)))) ; (p (p (p 0.4351))) ; (p (p 0.9758)) ; (p -0.7892) ; -0.4044 The p procedure has been applied five times. Considering that p can be solved in constant time and occupies constant space, the order of growth in space and the number of steps for \\(p\\left(a\\right)\\) is \\(\\Theta\\left(\\lg n\\right)\\) . This can be shown by noticing that \\(p\\left(3a\\right)\\) requires a constant number of operations more than \\(p\\left(a\\right)\\) , for instance, the amount of space and operations for (sine 1.35) versus that of (sine 4.05) .

Removing even numbers as candidate divisors reduced the amount of time to compute by 27%. This is different from the 50% reduction that would have been expected by removing 50% of the candidate divisors. This is perhaps attributed to the time it takes for next to be evaluated, and the if function inside it.

This satisfies \\(\\Theta\\left(T\\left(n\\right)\\right)=\\Theta\\left(\\log n\\right)\\) . Exercise 1.25 \u00b6 The original procedure is as follows: (define (expmod base exp m) (define (square x) (* x x)) (cond ((= exp 0) 1) ((even? exp) (remainder (square (expmod base (/ exp 2) m)) m)) (else (remainder (* base (expmod base (- exp 1) m)) m)))) and the modified is as follows: (define (expmod base exp m) (remainder (fast-expt base exp) m)) The issue here is that (fast-expt ...) has to be evaluated first, and base and exp can be ridiculously high. After all of that, its remainder when divided by m is computed, and all that computational power might have been wasted. The original keeps the working value no more than m , and this is indicated by the remainder operation after every step. Exercise 1.26 \u00b6 \"...you have transformed the \\(\\Theta\\left(\\log n\\right)\\) process into a \\(\\Theta\\left(n\\right)\\) process.\" Consider first why the square procedure is being used. This is to avoid computing the value twice, as (expmod base (/ exp 2) m) would have already been evaluated and stored somewhere, and what is left to be done is to multiply its value by itself. By using (* (expmod base (/ exp 2) m) (expmod base (/ exp 2) m)) , computation would be done twice every recursive call. By doubling exp , the number of calls it takes to compute will then double, compared to just increasing by one if square were used. This can be proven using induction. Suppose that expmod takes \\(T\\left(n\\right)\\) time to compute where \\(n\\) is our exp . If we double exp , the time it takes for the (remainder (* ...)) code to run will be \\(2T\\left(n\\right)\\) , since each expmod call takes \\(T\\left(n\\right)\\) . Because of this linear relationship, \\(\\Theta\\left(T\\left(n\\right)\\right)=\\Theta\\left(n\\right)\\) Exercise 1.27 \u00b6 (define (test-camichael n) (define (expmod base exp m) (define (even? n) (= (remainder n 2) 0)) (define (square x) (* x x)) (cond ((= exp 0) 1) ((even? exp) (remainder (square (expmod base (/ exp 2) m)) m)) (else (remainder (* base (expmod base (- exp 1) m)) m)))) ; test-camichael-recursive tests for every a < n.

By using (* (expmod base (/ exp 2) m) (expmod base (/ exp 2) m)) , computation would be done twice every recursive call.
